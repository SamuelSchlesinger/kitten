-- Note [Angle Brackets]:
--
-- Since we separate the passes of tokenization and parsing, we are faced with a
-- classic ambiguity between angle brackets as used in operator names such as
-- '>>' and '<+', and as used in type argument and parameter lists such as
-- 'vector<vector<T>>' and '<+E>'.
--
-- Our solution is to parse a less-than or greater-than character as an 'angle'
-- token if it was immediately followed by a symbol character in the input, with
-- no intervening whitespace. This is enough information for the parser to
-- disambiguate the intent:
--
--   • When parsing an expression, it joins a sequence of angle tokens and
--     an operator token into a single operator token.
--
--   • When parsing a signature, it treats them separately.
--
-- You may ask why we permit this silly ambiguity in the first place. Why not
-- merge the passes of tokenization and parsing, or use a different bracketing
-- character such as '[]' for type argument lists?
--
-- We separate tokenization and parsing for the sake of tool support: it's
-- simply easier to provide token-accurate source locations when we keep track
-- of source locations at the token level, and it's easier to provide a list of
-- tokens to external tools (e.g., for syntax highlighting) if we already have
-- such a list at hand.
--
-- The reason for the choice of bracketing character is for the sake of
-- compatibility with C++ tools. When setting a breakpoint in GDB, for example,
-- it's nice to be able to type:
--
--     break foo::bar<int>
--
-- And for this to refer to the Kitten definition 'foo::bar<int>' precisely,
-- rather than to some syntactic analogue such as 'foo.bar[int]'. The modest
-- increase in complexity of implementation is justified by fostering a better
-- experience for people.

-- Note [Float Literals]:
--
-- Floating-point literals are represented as a pair of an arbitrary-precision
-- integer significand and exponent, so that:
--
--     Float a b c
--
-- Denotes the floating point number (a × 10^(c - b)). This representation was
-- chosen to avoid loss of precision until the token is converted into a machine
-- floating-point format. The exponent is split into two parts to indicate which
-- part of the literal that exponent came from: the fractional part, or the
-- exponent in scientific notation.

float :: Fractional a => Integer -> Int -> Int -> a
float a b c = let
  e = c - b
  -- The intermediate rational step is necessary to preserve precision.
  shift = if e < 0 then 1 % 10 ^ negate e else 10 ^ e
