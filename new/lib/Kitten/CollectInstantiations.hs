-- In order to support unboxed generics, for every call site of a generic
-- definition in a program, we produce a specialized instantiation of the
-- definition with the value-kinded type parameters set to the given type
-- arguments. This is transitive: if a generic definition calls another generic
-- definition with one of its own generic type parameters as a type argument,
-- then an instantiation must also be generated of the called definition.
